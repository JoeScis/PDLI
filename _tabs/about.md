Hi, welcome to my About Me page...

I'm passionate about helping others be successful, continuous learning, continuous delivery and creating an environment for people to thrive in.

Interested in technology, lean, process improvement, waste reduction, agility, human structures, scaling delivery & operations, portfolio & product management, servant leadership, modern management, psychology and min/maxing efficiency & effectiveness. 

Proven to work in complex environments with emerging requirements, expedited timelines, high volatility and constant change/pivoting.

…more of a Thinker & Doer, rather than a Talker…
